 <p>India has two primary stock markets where most of its trading takes place: the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).
  The BSE is the older stock exchange and has more than double the firms listed than the NSE.
  Trading at both exchanges takes place through an open electronic limit order book in which order matching is done by the trading computer.
  Both indexes share the same trading hours, trading mechanisms, and settlement processes, and are regulated by the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
  Two popular indexes based on the Indian markets are the Sensex and Nifty.
  To invest in the Indian markets, one needs to be registered as a foreign institutional investor
  Most of the trading in the Indian stock market takes place on its two stock exchanges: the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The BSE has been in existence since 1875. The NSE, on the other hand, was founded in 1992 and started trading in 1994; however, both exchanges follow the same trading mechanism, trading hours, and settlement process.

  Almost all the significant firms of India are listed on both exchanges. The BSE is the older stock market but the NSE is the largest stock market, in terms of volume. Both exchanges compete for the order flow that leads to reduced costs, market efficiency, and innovation. The presence of arbitrageurs keeps the prices on the two stock exchanges within a very tight range.</p>
