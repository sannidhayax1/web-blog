High-quality blog content. The content should demonstrate expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (EAT). It is also important to use easy-to-understand language and formatting to make the blog post digestible.
Inviting headlines. These reveal what the content is about and help attract visitors to the content, as around 80% of people will click search engine results if the headlines are compelling.

Smooth user experience (UX). Other than attractive design, great blogs generally have a seamless page experience as it is an important element in blog search engine optimization (SEO).
